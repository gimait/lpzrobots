  /**
   * This is the abstract base class of the component system. A component includes the routines for managing sensor and motor values from a controller.
   * With a bunch of components it is possible to create a tree like structure. There is always a root structure.
   * Components could be used as normal robot objects, so they can get motor and sensor values. These values are shared with all components in the tree structure of a component.
   * Between the differnt objects of the component class could exist connections, which are physical represented by Ode-Joints.
   * The components use the motor values they get, to control the joints between them.
   * From these joints sensor values are read out, which where send with the getSensor () function like a normal robot does.
   * But the arrray of sensor values comes from all components within the structure beneth the component, from which the function was called.
   * You could say that each component is a non physical shell around a physical object like a primitive or a robot in classical meaning of this project.
   * These shells build a connection between the physical parts and control these connections, which could be also physical existend.
